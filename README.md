# javascript-sdk for Buen Día Builders - Week 1 Assignment

This folder contains the code developed for the "Semana 1: Tarea 2 - Buen Día Builders" project using JavaScript. The scripts in this directory are intended to demonstrate basic operations such as creating accounts, checking balances, and sending payments through a simple SDK-like structure.

- `package.json`: Project dependencies and configuration for Node.js.
- `.gitignore`: Files and directories to be excluded from version control.

## Project Objective

The purpose of this assignment is to practice basic JavaScript programming skills and introduce concepts such as working with files, simple data management, and simulating an SDK (Software Development Kit) for account operations. The assignment demonstrates how to structure code for typical financial operations, which could serve as a basis for more complex automation in the future.

## Requirements

- Node.js (v24.x or later recommended)
- Project dependencies (install with `npm install`)
